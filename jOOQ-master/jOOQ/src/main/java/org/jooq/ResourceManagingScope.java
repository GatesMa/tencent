/**
 * A scope that can manage resources.
 * <p>
 * This is a type of {@link Scope} that can manage resources on behalf of the
 * call site, and free / close those resources once the scope ends.
 * <p>
 * For example, {@link Binding} implementations may wish to create {@link Clob}
 * or {@link InputStream} or other kinds of resources in order to bind them to
 * JDBC. Instead of remembering to close them manually through some delicate
 * logic involving e.g. clever usage of {@link ThreadLocal}, implementations can
 * register their resources with the methods exposed here, and jOOQ will take
 * care of freeing / closing them at the right moment.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Example:</strong>
 * <p>
 * <code><pre>
 * class StreamingLobBinding implements Binding&lt;String, File&gt; {
 *     ...
 *     public void set(BindingSetStatementContext&lt;File&gt; ctx) {
 *         ctx.statement()
 *            .setBinaryStream(ctx.index(), ctx.closeAfterExecution(new FileInputStream(ctx.value())));
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre></code>
