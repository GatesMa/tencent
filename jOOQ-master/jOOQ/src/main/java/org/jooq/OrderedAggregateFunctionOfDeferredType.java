/**
 * An ordered-set aggregate function.
 * <p>
 * An ordered-set aggregate function is an aggregate function with a mandatory
 * Oracle-specific <code>WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ..)</code> clause. An example is
 * <code>LISTAGG</code>: <code><pre>
 * SELECT   LISTAGG(TITLE, ', ')
 *          WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY TITLE)
 * FROM     T_BOOK
 * GROUP BY AUTHOR_ID
 * </pre></code> The above function groups books by author and aggregates titles
 * into a concatenated string.
 * <p>
 * Ordered-set aggregate functions can be further converted into window functions
 * using the <code>OVER(PARTITION BY ..)</code> clause. For example: <code><pre>
 * SELECT LISTAGG(TITLE, ', ')
 *        WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY TITLE)
 *        OVER (PARTITION BY AUTHOR_ID)
 * FROM   T_BOOK
 * </pre></code>
