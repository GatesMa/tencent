/**
 * This base class is extended by all XJC-generated {@link Settings} classes
 * <p>
 * Using such a base class seems to be a lot simpler than depending on any one
 * of those many JAXB / XJC plugins. Besides, cloning objects through the
 * standard Java {@link Cloneable} mechanism is around factor 1000x faster than
 * using {@link Serializable}, and even 10000x faster than using
 * {@link javax.xml.bind.JAXB#marshal(Object, java.io.OutputStream)},
 * marshalling a JAXB object into a {@link ByteArrayOutputStream}.
