/**
 * A window specification.
 * <p>
 * Window specifications are the syntactic clauses that can be passed to both
 * window definitions in <code>WINDOW</code> clauses, as well as to the
 * <code>OVER</code> clause of window functions. This makes window
 * specifications highly reusable across several queries.
 * <p>
 * Example: <code><pre>
 * WindowSpecification spec =
 * DSL.partitionBy(BOOK.AUTHOR_ID)
 *    .orderBy(BOOK.ID)
 *    .rowsBetweenUnboundedPreceding()
 *    .andCurrentRow();
 * </pre></code>
 * <p>
 * Instances can be created using {@link DSL#partitionBy(Field...)},
 * {@link DSL#orderBy(OrderField...)}, and overloads as well as rows / range /
 * groups related methods in {@link DSL}.
