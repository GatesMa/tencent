/**
 * This type is used for the {@link Delete}'s DSL API.
 * <p>
 * Example: <code><pre>
 * DSLContext create = DSL.using(configuration);
 *
 * create.delete(table)
 *       .where(field1.greaterThan(100))
 *       .execute();
 * </pre></code>
 * <p>
 * <h3>Referencing <code>XYZ*Step</code> types directly from client code</h3>
 * <p>
 * It is usually not recommended to reference any <code>XYZ*Step</code> types
 * directly from client code, or assign them to local variables. When writing
 * dynamic SQL, creating a statement's components dynamically, and passing them
 * to the DSL API statically is usually a better choice. See the manual's
 * section about dynamic SQL for details: <a href=
 * "https://www.jooq.org/doc/latest/manual/sql-building/dynamic-sql">https://www.jooq.org/doc/latest/manual/sql-building/dynamic-sql</a>.
 * <p>
 * Drawbacks of referencing the <code>XYZ*Step</code> types directly:
 * <ul>
 * <li>They're operating on mutable implementations (as of jOOQ 3.x)</li>
 * <li>They're less composable and not easy to get right when dynamic SQL gets
 * complex</li>
 * <li>They're less readable</li>
 * <li>They might have binary incompatible changes between minor releases</li>
 * </ul>
