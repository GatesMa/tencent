/**
 * The <code>ExecutorProvider</code> SPI can be used to provide jOOQ with custom
 * asynchronous execution behaviour.
 * <p>
 * Asynchronous operations will call back to this SPI to obtain an executor.
 * This applies, for example, to {@link ResultQuery#fetchAsync()}.
 * <p>
 * The following logic is applied when resolving the appropriate
 * <code>executor</code>:
 * <ol>
 * <li>If {@link Configuration#executorProvider()} does not return
 * <code>null</code>, then {@link #provide()} is called to obtain an
 * <code>Executor</code> for the asynchronous task.</li>
 * <li>In the jOOQ Java 8 distribution, {@link ForkJoinPool#commonPool()} is
 * used if <code>{@link ForkJoinPool#getCommonPoolParallelism()} &gt; 1</code></li>
 * <li>A new "one thread per call" <code>Executor</code> is used in any other
 * case.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * The SPI will not be called if an asynchronous operation explicitly overrides
 * the {@link Executor}, e.g. as is the case for
 * {@link ResultQuery#fetchAsync(Executor)}.
